# Hotel_booking_analysis
This project is an end to end data analysis project using python and jupyter notebook is used as a tool in which data of hotels is analysed for their lowering revenues due to cancellation of their reservations.

# 📌 Overview

This project analyzes hotel booking data from 2015 to 2017 to identify patterns, cancellation trends, and factors affecting revenue. The goal is to help hotels minimize cancellations, optimize pricing strategies, and improve overall revenue management.

The analysis was conducted in Python (Jupyter Notebook) with data visualization and statistical insights, and summarized in a detailed business report.

# 🚩 Business Problem

Hotels, especially city hotels and resorts, face high booking cancellation rates leading to:

- Reduced revenues 💸

- Low room occupancy 🛏️

- Inefficient resource utilization 📉

This project aims to analyze factors influencing cancellations and provide actionable suggestions for hotel management.

# 🔍 Research Questions

1. What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?

2. How can cancellation rates be reduced?

3. How can hotels improve pricing and promotional decisions?

# 📊 Key Findings

- 37% of bookings were cancelled, significantly impacting hotel revenue.

- City hotels received more bookings than resort hotels, possibly due to lower prices.

- Cancellations peak in January and confirmed bookings peak in August.

- Portugal recorded the highest number of cancellations.

- 46% of reservations came through online travel agencies, followed by groups (27%).

- Higher average daily rates (ADR) strongly correlated with higher cancellations.

# 💡 Suggestions

1. Revise Pricing Strategy – Offer discounts during high cancellation months or for specific locations.

2. Focus on City Hotels – Provide weekend/holiday discounts to attract more customers.

3. Targeted Marketing in January – Run campaigns during high cancellation periods.

4. Improve Services in Portugal – Reduce cancellations by enhancing amenities and customer satisfaction.
